                    Fish is a highly demanded commodity at both national and international levels. It is also a
potential export earner among the agricultural and allied sector. Marketing plays a crucial role
in addressing the problems of developing countries viz., food security, poverty and sustainable
agriculture. A fish value chain is the full range of activities that are required to bring a product
or service from its conception to the final consumers. The actors of the value chain include
producers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers. Fish wholesalers and retailers are the active
market functionaries and the basis of operation and product transaction is based on mutual trust
even today</p>

                    Fish marketing is the activity of distributing goods and services from producer to consumer.
The basis for the marketing of any product depended components of the marketing mix.
Marketing is a set of marketing tool used to promote and sell a product or services in the market.
It included positioning and deciding the product to sell at the right place, at right price and right
time. The four P’ concept was developed by Neil Bordan (1950) that includes Product, Price,
Place and Promotion. The market research and its strategy depended on the components of
marketing mix. In the modern era, the four P’s concept was extended into seven P’s by including
process, promotion and physical environment. Performance is the recent addition to the
components of marketing mix.</p>
